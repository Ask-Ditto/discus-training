            <h2>Why Question Quality Matters</h2>
            <p>
              In synthetic research, the quality of your insights depends entirely on the
              quality of your questions. Well-crafted questions elicit honest, thoughtful
              responses that reveal true consumer sentiments. Poorly worded questions lead to
              confusion, bias, and unreliable results.

            <h2>Golden Rules of Question Writing</h2>

            <h3>1. Be Specific and Concrete</h3>
            <p>
              Vague questions generate vague answers. Always provide enough context and
              specificity for respondents to understand exactly what you're asking.

            <h3>2. Avoid Leading or Biased Questions</h3>
            <p>
              Leading questions push respondents toward a particular answer, tainting your

            <h3>Comparative Questions</h3>
            <p>
              Ask respondents to compare options, revealing preferences and differentiation.
              Essential for competitive analysis and positioning.

            <h3>Behavioral Questions</h3>
            <p>
              Focus on actual behaviors rather than hypothetical intentions. Past behavior is
              the best predictor of future behavior.

            <p>
              Ask respondents to project themselves into scenarios or anthropomorphize brands.

            <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
              <div class="warning-box-header">
                <span class="warning-icon">⚠️</span>
                <h4>Pitfall #1: Hypothetical Questions</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> Asking "Would you buy..." or "How likely would you
                be to..." generates unreliable responses. People are terrible at predicting
                their future behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Focus on past behavior, current perceptions, or
                specific barriers. Instead of "Would you buy this?", ask "What would need to
                be true for you to consider buying this?"
              </p>
            </div>

                <h4>Pitfall #2: Assuming Universal Brand Awareness</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> Not all respondents know your brand. Questions that
                assume familiarity exclude important perspectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Include a qualifier or provide brief context. "If
                you're familiar with [Brand], what's your impression?" or provide a one-line
                brand description.
              </p>

                <h4>Pitfall #3: Too Many Questions</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> Long surveys cause fatigue and declining response
                quality. Each additional question increases drop-off.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Be ruthless in prioritizing. Ask only questions
                that drive specific decisions. Aim for 5-8 core questions maximum per study.
              </p>
            </div>

                <h4>Pitfall #4: Asking About Price Without Context</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> "What would you pay for this?" generates unrealistically
                low numbers. Everyone wants things cheaper.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Provide competitive context or use van Westendorp
                pricing methodology. "At what price would you consider this a bargain?" / "At
                what price would it seem too expensive?"

            <h2>Checklist: Before You Launch</h2>
            <p>
              Before finalizing your research questions, run through this checklist:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                ✓ <strong>Clear objective:</strong> Does each question tie to a specific
                decision or hypothesis?
              </li>
              <li>
                ✓ <strong>Single focus:</strong> Is each question about one thing only?
              </li>
              <li>
                ✓ <strong>No bias:</strong> Are questions neutral without leading language?
              </li>
              <li>
                ✓ <strong>Simple language:</strong> Would a typical consumer understand every
                word?
              </li>
              <li>
                ✓ <strong>Necessary context:</strong> Have you provided background where needed?
              </li>
              <li>
                ✓ <strong>Actionable:</strong> Will the answers actually inform decisions?
              </li>
              <li>
                ✓ <strong>Realistic scope:</strong> Can respondents reasonably answer based on
                their knowledge?
              </li>
              <li>
                ✓ <strong>Proper sequence:</strong> Do questions flow logically from general to
                specific?
              </li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Pro Tip: Test Your Questions</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                Before launching a major study, test your questions on 5-10 people who match
                your target audience. Ask them to think aloud as they answer. This quickly
                reveals confusing language, missing context, or unintended interpretations.
